# soccer-statistics
Python code to analyze season statistics provided by the soccer API available at https://elenasport.io. Based on user-inputted league, country, and season parameters, this code automates the API request process, filters data and generates a linear regression model of the correlation between the total of home points earned by a team in the chosen season and its mean home attendance throughout the year.
